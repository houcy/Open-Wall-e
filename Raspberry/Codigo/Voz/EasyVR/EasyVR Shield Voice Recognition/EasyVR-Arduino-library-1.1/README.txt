EasyVR library 1.0 for Arduino
------------------------------

This archive contains libraries for Arduino development environment (IDE).

There is a folder for the old Arduino alpha version 0022, that also contains
modified software serial libraries required by the EasyVR library.

Another folder is for the upcoming Arduino version 1.0, that can be used with
recent beta versions.

According to the version of the Arduino software installed on your PC, select
the appropriate folder and copy the contents of the "libraries" sub-folder
to your PC, in the same location you installed your Arduino software
distribution.


For example:

If you have installed Arduino 0022 in your hard-drive folder:
"D:\arduino-0022"

Then you should unzip the archive folder "arduino-0022/libraries" to your
hard-drive folder: "D:\arduino-0022\libraries"


See also the EasyVR User Manual (a recent version) for product documentation.
